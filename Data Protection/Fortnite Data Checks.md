<h3>Fortnite data validation/ anti-tampering</h3>
<p>For all games, including Fortnite, the TOC dispatcher will not mount any TOC that has tampered headers, although Fortnite has a special type of tampering checks.</p>

<p>One of the main checks they use is compression blocks (FIoStoreTocCompressedBlockEntry), basically too many modified compression blocks equals an automatic kick from the game, for the reason "Verifcation Required".</p>
